## Learning Goals

- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Test both API consumption and exposure, making use of at least one mocking tool (VCR, Webmock, etc).


## Requirements and Setup (for Mac):

### Ruby and Rails
- Ruby Version 3.2.2
- Rails Version 7.0.8

### Gems Utilized
- RSpec 
- Pry
- SimpleCov
- Factory_Bot_Rails
- Faker
- Shoulda-Matchers 
- Webmock
- VCR
- bcrypt
- jsonapi-serializer
- Faraday

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
On your local machine open a terminal session and enter the following commands for SSH or HTTPS to clone the repositiory.


- using ssh key <br>
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:Daniel-Gallagher92/sweater_weather.git
```

- using https <br>
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Gallagher92/sweater_weather.git
```

Once cloned, you'll have a new local copy in the directory you ran the clone command in.

2. Navigate to where you've chosen to store the project directory:<br>

```shell
$ cd sweater_weather
```
3. Open in your favorite code editor
   
4. Install required Gems utilizing Bundler: <br>
If Bundler is not installed, first run the following command.

```shell
$ gem install bundler
```

If Bundler *is* already installed, run the following command.

```shell
$ bundle install
```

After running the following command, you should see a list of all gem's installed by bundler.

Now let's get that database set up!

```shell
$ rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
```
